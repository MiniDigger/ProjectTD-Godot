# ProjectTD

TowerDefence Game build using the Godot engine, written in C#

## Running

This project currently uses Godot mono 3.2 beta. So install that. Then just clone this repo and open the folder.

## Development

I use Jetbrains Rider to write this game, but any IDE (for example VS code) should do the trick. Code is in the scripts/ folder.

## Attribution

This project uses game assets by kenny.nl, in particular the TowerDefence pack of his Game Assets 2 bundle: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/tower-defense-top-down
